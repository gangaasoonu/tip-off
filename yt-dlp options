Thx to https://www.tecmint.com/download-mp3-song-from-youtube-videos/

install yt-dlp using pacman, not as pip3
-i to read from file 
-a to ignore errors and continue to next URL
-U to update
download a video as an mp3 track, we need the following two options:

    --extract-audio (short option -x) – Convert video files to audio-only files.
    --audio-format  – specifies the audio format in which the file will be downloaded.

The supported audio formats are “best“, “aac“, “vorbis“, “mp3“, “m4a“, “opus“, or “wav“; “best” is set by default.

--embed-thumbnail to get thumbnail

only needed one's in a Playlist


    --playlist-start NUMBER – Playlist video to start at (default is 1).
    --playlist-end NUMBER – Playlist video to end at (default is last).

Where "NUMBER" is the starting and ending point of the playlist. The command below will download the first 5 songs from the given playlist:

$ yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --playlist-start 1 --playlist-end 5 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9LUD5Kp855InMnKTaRy3LH3kTIYJyBzs

Download Multiple MP3 from Youtube Playlist

download partly uses ffmpeg, takes hell a lot of time, not worth..

now, I need some hack to choose the quality.... viz., run yt-dlp -F, read & choose the optimal one... then run yt-dlp -f <quality indicator>
